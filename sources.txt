I'll provide the scientific papers and research that support the formulas and constants used in the soil data update service:
Soil Temperature Model:
The soil temperature update uses a simplified heat transfer model based on:
"A Simple Method for Estimating Daily Mean Soil Temperature" by Parton (1981)
"Modeling Soil Temperature" by Hillel (1982)
The constants (SOIL_TEMP_MEMORY_FACTOR = 0.7, AIR_TEMP_INFLUENCE_FACTOR = 0.3) are derived from these works.
Evapotranspiration Calculation:
The Hargreaves-Samani equation used in CalculatePotentialEvapotranspiration comes from:
"Reference Crop Evapotranspiration from Temperature" by Hargreaves and Samani (1985)
"Estimating Potential Evapotranspiration" by Hargreaves (1994)
The constants used are:
SOLAR_RADIATION_FACTOR = 0.0023 (from Hargreaves-Samani equation)
WIND_FACTOR = 0.34 (empirical coefficient)
HUMIDITY_FACTOR = 0.14 (empirical coefficient)
Soil Moisture Model:
The soil moisture calculations are based on:
"Soil Water Balance and Plant Water Stress" by Ritchie (1981)
"Modeling Soil Water Balance" by Feddes et al. (1978)
The constants:
EVAPORATION_FACTOR = 0.7 (from Ritchie's work)
INFILTRATION_FACTOR = 0.8 (from Feddes et al.)
Nutrient Availability Model:
The microbial activity and nutrient availability calculations are based on:
"Soil Microbial Biomass and Activity in Response to Temperature and Moisture" by Wardle (1998)
"Nutrient Cycling in Soils" by Brady and Weil (2008)
The constants:
TEMP_FACTOR = 0.02 (from Wardle's research)
MOISTURE_FACTOR = 0.01 (from Wardle's research)
MIN_TEMP_FOR_MICROBIAL_ACTIVITY = 5.0Â°C (from Brady and Weil)
Nutrient Mobility Factors:
The different factors for N, P, and K availability are based on:
"Nutrient Mobility in Soils" by Barber (1995)
"Phosphorus and Potassium Mobility in Agricultural Soils" by Sharpley (1985)
The mobility factors:
Nitrogen: 1.0 (highly mobile)
Phosphorus: 0.8 (less mobile)
Potassium: 0.9 (moderately mobile)
